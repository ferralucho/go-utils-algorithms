/*
Using a channel, we can make sure the main task waits until the asynchronous task is complete.
When the goroutine completes itsâ€™ work, it will send a value through the channel done , which will be read before operating on the numbers array.
Channels can be buffered if you want to prevent blocking further execution until a value is
eventually read from the channel to free it up.

Channels can be non-buffered if you want 1-in-1-out behavior.
